"<em>Rich editing</em>, also called WYSIWYG for What You See Is What You Get, "

"behind the scenes while you concentrate on writing. Font styles, links and "

"WordPress includes a rich HTML editor that works well in all major web "
"browsers used today. However editing HTML is not the same as typing text. "
"Each web page has two major components: the structure, which is the actual "
"HTML code and is produced by the editor as you type, and the display, that "
"is applied to it by the currently selected WordPress theme and is defined in "
"style.css. WordPress is producing valid XHTML 1.0 which means that inserting "
"multiple line breaks (BR tags) after a paragraph would not produce white "
"space on the web page. The BR tags will be removed as invalid by the "
"internal HTML correcting functions."

"While using the editor, most basic keyboard shortcuts work like in any other "

"use the Command key instead of Ctrl). See the Hotkeys tab for all available "
